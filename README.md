# README

This repository contains supplementary digital resources, scripts, and files used in the paper Porter et al. 2023 "All boreal forest successional stages needed to maintain the full suite of biodiversity, community composition, and function following wildfire." Scientific Reports, 13: 7978.

## Digital Resources

We used some key references from the literature to produce lists of fire-associated organisms and traits that can be easily imported into R for analysis.

Comma-separated file (CSV) file of fire-associated arthropods that can be used to screen datasets for pyrophilous arthropods.  If you use this file please site the original sources published largely by Wikars (1997) that are listed in the file.  

CSV file of fire-loving fungi.  If you use this file please site the original sources published largely by Zak and Wicklow (1980) as well as Dix and Webster (1995). 

CSV file of terrestrial arthropod functional feeding guilds.  These functions were assigned based on the literature with effort made to use the same terminology used by the US EPA for functional feeding guilds in freshwater macroinvertebrates where possible to facilitate comparisons across these diverse taxa.

CSV file of fungal traits for rhizomorph-forming, ericoid, and fire-associated fungi.  Column names were chosen to be compatible with the FungalTraits database.  If you use this file please cite the original sources largely from Boddy (1993) for saprotrophic rhizomorph-forming fungi,  Agerer (2006) for ectomycorrhizal rhizomorph-forming fungi, as well as Zak and Wicklow (1980) and Dix and Webster (1995) for fire-loving fungi.

CSV file of FAPROTAX bacterial traits supplemented with additional N fixation, K and P solubilization traits by Sansupa et al. (2021) and further supplemented with additional taxa with chitinolytic capabilities.  Formatted for use with FAPROTAX.

Fig 1 Experimental design.  
Fig 2 Contrasting patterns of diversity seen for soil bacteria, fungi, and arthropods.  
Fig 3 Contrasting recovery patterns of soil taxa along an 85-year chronosequence following natural wildfire disturbance.  
Fig 4 Each stand development stage is important for maintaining gamma diversity and whole community nestedness.  
Fig 5 Major groups vary across the post-fire chronosequence.  

Fig S1 Fire-origin soil communities are largely distinct from one stand development stage to the next.  
Fig S2 Fungal nestedness and specialization across stand development stages.  
Fig S3 Nestedness patterns vary across major fungal functional and taxonomic groups.  
Fig S4 The diversity and frequency of fire-associated fungal species is highest from fire-origin sites at the establishment stage.  
Fig S5 Frequency of bacterial genera that may be associated with fire-origin sites.  
Fig S6 Frequency of insect genera that may be associated with fire-origin sites.  
Fig S7 Rarefaction curves plateau indicating sequencing depth was sufficient for each amplicon.
