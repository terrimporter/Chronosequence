This repository contains supplementary digital resources, scripts, and files used in the paper Porter et al. 2022 In prep.

## Digital Resources

We used some key references from the literature to produce list of fire-associated organisms and traits that can be easily imported into R for analysis.

Comma-separated file (CSV) file of fire-associated arthropods that can be used to screen datasets for pyrophilous arthropods.  If you use this file please site the original sources published largely by Wikars (1997) that are listed in the file.  

CSV file of fire-loving fungi.  If you use this file please site the original sources published largely by Zak and Wicklow (1980) as well as Dix and Webster (1995). 

CSV file of terrestrial arthropod functional feeding guilds.  These functions were assigned based on the literature with effort made to use the same terminology used by the US EPA for functional feeding guilds in freshwater macroinvertebrates where possible to facilitate comparisons across these diverse taxa.

CSV file of fungal traits for rhizomorph-forming, ericoid, and fire-associated fungi.  Column names were chosen to be compatible with the FungalTraits database.  If you use this file please cite the original sources largely from Boddy (1993) for saprotrophic rhizomorph-forming fungi,  Agerer (2006) for ectomycorrhizal rhizomorph-forming fungi, as well as Zak and Wicklow (1980) and Dix and Webster (1995) for fire-loving fungi.

CSV file of FAPROTAX bacterial traits supplemented with additional N fixation, K and P solubilization traits by Sansupa et al. (2021) and further supplemented with additional taxa with chitinolytic capabilities.  Formatted for use with FAPROTAX.

Fig 1 Post0fire recovery of bacteria, fungi, and arthropod communities.  
Fig 2 The relative read abundance of top taxa fluctuates along the 80-year fire recovery chronosequence.  
Fig 3 Development stage bioindicators in fire-origin sites.  
Fig 4 Convergence between natural wildfire and harvest disturbance varies by taxonomic group.  
Fig 5 Recovery patterns following full-tree clearcut harvest and salvage disturbance varies with organismal group in soil.  
Fig 6 Sampling locations in northern Ontario, Canada.  

Fig S1 High level overview of major taxa detected in fire-origin sites at each stand development stage.  
Fig S2 In wildfire sites, ESVs cluster by development stage.  
Fig S3 Summary of soil and climate characteristics for harvest sites with respect to the reference condition.  
Fig S4 Fire-origin soil communities are largely distinct from one stand development stage to the next.  
Fig S5 Relative read abundance reveals differences among major taxa and functional groups across development stages.  
Fig S6 Samples are structured primarily by soil layer.  
Fig S7 Key gradients of variation within and among stand development stages in fire-origin sites.  
Fig S8 The diversity and frequency of fire-assocaited fungal species is highest from fire-origin sites at the establishment stage.  
Fig S9 Frequency of insect genera that may be associated with fire-origin sites.  
Fig S10 High level overview of taxa from wildfire-, full tree clearcut harvest- and salvage harvest sites.  
Fig S11 Convergence of soil communities over time varies by taxon.  
Fig S12 Samples subjected to harvest-disturbance may need more than 60 years to fully 'recovery'.  
Fig S13 Dominant groups of understory vegetation differed in wildfire and harvest-origin sites.  
Fig S14 Rarefaction curves plateau indicating sequencing depth was sufficient for each amplicon.  
Fig S15 Fungal and arthropod communities show differences in richness according to soil layer, disturbance, and development stage.  
Fig S16 Strongly correlated understory vegetation are shown for fire-origin sites.  
Fig S17 Strongly correlated climate and soil characteristics.  
Fig S18 Strongly crrelated organismal metrics.
